						<h3 class="name">Jade Booth</h3>
						<p><b>Bride</b><br>"Jade aka Monkey lit up or lives from day one.
In the early years fuelled by tea(thanks Grandad) the party girl only stopped dancing briefly to announce that "Chocolate makes you beautiful". Weymouth became her adopted home as the Lake District fells had no escalators.
Jade's energy and drive now fuelled more by G&T(thanks Nan) than tea saw her graduate from Newcastle Uni and attain her current role in the West Midlands Police Force.
So now our little Monkey is on the verge of the biggest party of her new life with Simon and yes Jade chocolate does make you beautiful.

						<h3 class="name">Simon Forbes</h3>
						<p><b>Groom</b><br>“Simon, otherwise known as Si,  was a happy, relaxed baby and child , his childhood passed in a blur of fun, laughter and friendship, making friends where ever he went. From an early age Si discovered books and had his nose in one whenever not playing board games. 
Many Friday nights spent in The Green Dragon honed his love for real ale  ( like his Dad who also searched for the perfect pint).
Joining the Royal Navy and passing out as an officer was challenging, rewarding and made us all very proud but Si has been at his happiest since meeting Jade whose warmth and friendliness has enhanced our family. 
It is lovely to see Simon so happy, relaxed and contented sharing a home with the woman he loves.  He has even realised that some things are better than beer. ” AF

						<p><b>Parents of the bride.</b><br>"I'm incredibly lucky to have such amazing parents who continuously drop everything to come to my rescue whether that be travelling hundreds of miles across the country, pulling a lego bucket off my head, driving across 5 counties to find a wedding dress, rescuing us from car breakdowns, spending an entire evening (and the small hours) helping with essays (that I definitely did not leave to the last minute), helping us move house even when sick and of course abandoning days out to come over for impromptu BBQ's - although that probably says more about Simon's BBQ skills."

						<h3 class="name">Ann & Malcolm Forbes</h3>
						<p><b>Parents of the husband person.</b><br>“Definitely my parents.  All round good eggs, double yokers one might say.  Dad is dead so if you see him at the wedding you should probably lay off the booze for a little while.  On a slightly more serious note (not that I wasn’t serious about dad being dead) they have supported me throughout the years, always looking out for my best interests so I’ve been extraordinarily lucky to have been birthed by my mother and father.” SF
<br><br>Ann’s specialist topics: sewing and stuff, grandchildren, sons cycling behind a car in pouring rain.
<br>Malcolm (deceased) specialists topics: Beer, ornithology, sleeping in front of the TV, Susan Cramner (maths teacher).</p>

						<p><b>Maid of honour</b><br>"After meeting Jenny on the first day of university (with a bottle of wkd) we've been best friends ever since. After somehow managing to fit in getting our history degree between all the visits to trebles bars (if you have any history based questions we suggest you ask our other halves) luckily for me Jenny went on to join the RN where she met Forbes and subsequently decided to play matchmaker. And for that I am eternally grateful. I am also grateful to her wonderful husband David, who somehow always seems to pay for us to go out everytime he's at sea." JB

Josie and Jade. Like Mel and Sue.  Just not as funny. Or talented. I doubt anyone else drinks as much gin during GBBO as we do. Probably explains why some of our bakes pre-show haven't always turned out quite as planned..." JB

						<p><b>Bridesmaid</b><br>"20 years of friendship that has included wearing kilts, trying to re-enact the Bolshevik revolution whilst in Russia (not advisable), getting to the Sports Cafe for 06:00 to drink vats of alcohol (with a bacon baguette - we are civilised) and watch the Lions tour during A-levels, plus a multitude of drunken escapades across the country that we somehow survived (pretty much) unscathed. The fact we both still have working livers is nothing short of a miracle." JB
